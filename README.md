### "Finding out the most relevant features for pricing of a house”
Terro’s real-estate is an agency that estimates the pricing of houses in a certain locality. The pricing is 
concluded based on different features / factors of a property. This also helps them in identifying the 
business value of a property. To do this activity the company employs an “Auditor”, who studies 
various geographic features of a property like pollution level (NOX), crime rate, education facilities 
(pupil to teacher ratio), connectivity (distance from highway), etc. This helps in determining the price 
of a property.

## Objective (Task):
Your job, as an auditor, is to analyze the magnitude of each variable to which it can affect the price of 
a house in a particular locality.
To do the analysis, you are expected to solve these questions:
1) Generate the summary statistics for each variable in the table. (Use Data analysis tool pack). Write 
down your observation. 
2) Plot a histogram of the Avg_Price variable. What do you infer? 
3) Compute the covariance matrix. Share your observations. 
4) Create a correlation matrix of all the variables (Use Data analysis tool pack). 
a) Which are the top 3 positively correlated pairs and 
b) Which are the top 3 negatively correlated pairs.
